1. Fetch all orders with their delivery time and estimated time:
   SELECT order_id, delivery_time, estimated_time FROM orders;

2. Get the total number of orders placed by each customer:
   SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;

3. Get the peak ordering hours (most popular hours of the day):
   SELECT HOUR(order_time) AS order_hour, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY order_hour
   ORDER BY order_hour;

4. Fetch all customers who have placed more than 5 orders:
   SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
   HAVING total_orders > 5;

5. Get the total amount spent by each customer:
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_price) AS total_spent
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id;

6. Fetch all deliveries where the delivery time is greater than the estimated time:
   SELECT * FROM deliveries
   WHERE delivery_time > estimated_time;

7. Find the top 5 most popular restaurants based on total orders:
   SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
   FROM restaurants r
   JOIN orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
   GROUP BY r.name
   ORDER BY total_orders DESC
   LIMIT 5;

8. Get the items most frequently ordered by each customer:
   SELECT customer_id, item_name, COUNT(*) AS frequency
   FROM orders
   JOIN order_items ON orders.order_id = order_items.order_id
   GROUP BY customer_id, item_name
   ORDER BY frequency DESC;

9. Find orders with a delivery time delay greater than 15 minutes:
   SELECT order_id, delivery_time, estimated_time, (delivery_time - estimated_time) AS delay
   FROM orders
   WHERE (delivery_time - estimated_time) > 15;

10. Get the customers who have ordered from a specific restaurant (e.g., 'Pizza Hut'):
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
    FROM orders o
    JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
    WHERE r.name = 'Pizza Hut';

11. Get the total number of deliveries and their average delay:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_deliveries, AVG(delivery_time - estimated_time) AS avg_delay
    FROM deliveries;

12. Find the restaurants with the highest number of deliveries (orders):
    SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
    FROM restaurants r
    JOIN orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
    GROUP BY r.name
    ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

13. Get the details of the order with the longest delivery time delay:
    SELECT order_id, delivery_time, estimated_time, (delivery_time - estimated_time) AS delay
    FROM orders
    ORDER BY delay DESC
    LIMIT 1;

14. Fetch the customers who have not placed any orders in the last 30 days:
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
        FROM orders
        WHERE order_date > CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
    );

15. Get the most ordered items for each restaurant:
    SELECT r.name AS restaurant_name, oi.item_name, COUNT(oi.item_name) AS total_orders
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    JOIN restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
    GROUP BY r.name, oi.item_name
    ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

16. Get the average delivery delay for each restaurant:
    SELECT r.name, AVG(d.delivery_time - d.estimated_time) AS avg_delay
    FROM restaurants r
    JOIN orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
    JOIN deliveries d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    GROUP BY r.name;

17. Get all orders for a specific customer (e.g., customer_id = 123):
    SELECT * FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = 123;

18. Find the items ordered by the most customers:
    SELECT item_name, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_customers
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    GROUP BY item_name
    ORDER BY num_customers DESC;

19. Get the average order value for each customer:
    SELECT customer_id, AVG(total_price) AS avg_order_value
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id;

20. Find the restaurants that have never had a delivery delay (i.e., where delivery time is equal to estimated time):
    SELECT r.name
    FROM restaurants r
    JOIN orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
    JOIN deliveries d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
    WHERE d.delivery_time = d.estimated_time
    GROUP BY r.name;
